            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my website, a combination blog/portfolio/place to host my projects! I'm a recent graduate from the University of Minnesota Morris
                and this is the revival of a site that I conceived of when I was in high school. I hope I can bring you along for my journey and teach some of the lessons I learn along the way! I've gathered so much
                from blogs just like this, and I'm eager to pay it back in whatever way I can.
            </p>
                I am primarily focused on AI and machine learning, and I mainly use Python and R to build the models that I've had experience with so far. With more soon to come,
                it's not unthinkable that I'll start writing about some of the more performance-friendly languages too in the near future. 
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
                Addionally, I'm also pretty interested in web development and server administration too, and this site itself is a product of that! 
                It's built from the ground up with Pelican, a static site generator much like Jekyll, and Pelican itself uses Jinja for templating. The template, from the CSS to the HTML and Javascript, 
                is all built by me from the ground up. The server itself is also hosted by me. Though I also have plenty of experience working with an Angular webstack, using a static site
                generator seemed much more appropriate for a website like this.
            </p>

                <h1>SAGE Project Portfolio</h1>
                <p>
                    SAGE is a game for teachers and students who want a way to improve student vocabulary. It is designed for a classroom setting. 
                    SAGE is an acronym for synonyms, antonyms, general sense, and example usage. In a game of SAGE, there are a number of cards the player will be presented with, 
                    each of them being worth points. The player is initially given just the word for a card. It is up to them to either guess the meaning of that word, 
                    or ask for a hint at the expense of some points. It's somewhat similar to games like Quiplash in that it is web-based with a host.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game itself is built with Angular and numerous other tools seen on the sidebar by myself and a software development team from the University of Minnesota Morris.
                    We developed the game using the Agile approach to development, working very closely with a teacher from a local school (our customer) right from the elevator pitch to the final iteration.
                    The code and more information on hosting the app is available on <a href="https://github.com/UMM-CSci-3601-F17/sage-team-cheezit">Github</a>. A taste of my personal contributions to the 
                    project and more information on the project itself is available <a href="{{ SITEURL }}/files/sageportfolio.pdf"> on my portfolio here</a>.
