            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my website, a combination blog/portfolio/place to host my projects! I'm a recent graduate from the University of Minnesota Morris
                and this is the revival of a site that I conceived of when I was in high school. I hope I can bring you along for my journey and teach some of the lessons I learn along the way! I've gathered so much
                from blogs just like this, and I'm eager to pay it back in whatever way I can.
            </p>
                I am primarily focused on AI and machine learning, and I mainly use Python and R to build the models that I've had experience with so far. With more soon to come,
                it's not unthinkable that I'll start writing about some of the more performance-friendly languages too in the near future. 
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
                Addionally, I'm also pretty interested in web development and server administration too, and this site itself is a product of that! 
                It's built from the ground up with Pelican, a static site generator much like Jekyll, and Pelican itself uses Jinja for templating. The template, from the CSS to the HTML and Javascript, 
                is all built by me from the ground up. The server itself is also hosted by me. Though I also have plenty of experience working with an Angular webstack, using a static site
                generator seemed much more appropriate for a website like this.
            </p>
